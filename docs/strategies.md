## Trading Algos

Given the data available in the Kline struct (which includes the symbol, interval, open, high, low, close prices, volume, open time, and close time), there are several types of trading algorithms you could implement. These algorithms can vary greatly in complexity and approach, depending on the trading strategy you wish to pursue. Here's a list of potential algorithm types based on the Kline data:

### Moving Average Crossover:

This strategy uses two moving averages (MA), a short-term MA and a long-term MA. A "buy" signal is generated when the short-term MA crosses above the long-term MA, and a "sell" signal is generated when the short-term MA crosses below the long-term MA.

### Relative Strength Index (RSI):

The RSI is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements. It oscillates between 0 and 100. Traditionally, and according to Wilder, RSI is considered overbought when above 70 and oversold when below 30.

### Bollinger Bands:

This method involves calculating a moving average of the security's price, and then creating two bands (the Bollinger Bands) above and below the moving average. The bands expand and contract based on the volatility of the prices.

### MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence):

The MACD is calculated by subtracting the long-term EMA (exponential moving average) from the short-term EMA. The MACD line is then plotted against a signal line (the EMA of the MACD) to identify potential buy or sell signals.

### Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP):

VWAP is calculated by adding up the money traded for every transaction (price multiplied by the number of shares traded) and then dividing by the total shares traded. This gives you an average price a security has traded at throughout the day, based on both volume and price. It is important for assessing whether a security was bought or sold at a good price.

### Breakout Strategy:

This strategy involves identifying a range or a price level that a security has failed to exceed previously (resistance) or fall below (support), and then opening positions as the price breaks out from that range or level.

### Mean Reversion:

Based on the assumption that prices and returns eventually move back towards the mean or average. This strategy might involve buying securities that have performed poorly recently and selling those that have performed well.

### Momentum Trading:

Identifies securities moving in one direction with high volume and continues to buy/sell them until they start showing signs of reversal.

### Pattern Recognition:

This involves identifying patterns within the price charts (like head and shoulders, triangles, flags, etc.) that can indicate potential bullish or bearish movements.
