## Overview

Raderbot is a Rust-based trading bot designed to interact with the Binance or BingX for market data analysis and trading operations. It utilizes the Actix Web framework for building a WebSocket server and handling incoming messages.

The bot connects to the exchange API to receive real-time market data updates, including ticker, trades and kline information.

## Getting Started

**Notes**:

- The project is still in the development phase, everything is still experimental and may not work or undocumented.
- Any contributions are welcome to source code or documentation.
- Build only work for Unix systems.
- Bot only runs in Dry Mode
- By default the bot starts with 3 active streams. It starts these streams and starts saving data from these streams. Use the API to check active streams.
- In order to run backtests you will need historical data. Pleas see [Historical Data](#historical-data) section for details on how to get historical data for the bot.

**Postman API Docs**:
Current API docs can be found here: [Postman Docs](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/22215488/2sA2xfYYa5)

1. Configure environment

- Change values of `.env.example`
- Rename `.env.example` to `.env`
- Run build

```sh
make build
```

2. Run Bot

```sh
./raderbot
```

3. Interact with bot through Postman on address `http://localhost:3000`

## Storage And Bootstrap

- By default the bot is configured to use system file storage. This means a directory is created within the user home directory at `~/.raderbot`. All data loaded through the `BootstrapKlineData` or `BootstrapTradeData` API requests will be saved here.
- All new market data is saved in this directory, data such as streamed K-Line data and Market Trades.
- It is possible to use a more performant storage solution such as MongoDB time series data. You will need access to MongoDB instance. In order to configure the bot to use MongoDB. Update the `.env` and restart the bot, new values are:

```
.env
...
STORAGE_TYPE=MONGO
MONGO_URI={NEW_URI}
...
```

## Historical Data

- In order to run `BootstrapKlineData` or `BootstrapTradeData` you will need to download the historical data first. The data can be downloaded from Binance, the data collections are:

- https://www.binance.com/en-AU/landing/data
  - K-Line
  - Aggregated Trades

The historical data will need to be placed in this exact directory `~/Projects/BinanceData`, the folder structure looks like this

```
   ~/Projects/BinanceData/
      ├── Kline/
         ├── BTCUSDT-5m-2023-12.csv
         ├── ...
         └── ...
      └── MarketTrade/
         ├── /BTCUSDT-aggTrades-2020-01.csv
         ├── ...
         └── ...
```

## Development

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following tools installed on your system:

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/): The programming language used for the project.
- [cargo-watch](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-watch): Used for automatically restarting the server during development.
- [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/): Used for managing development tasks.

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/subaquatic-pierre/raderbot.git

```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd raderbot
```

3. Build and run the project:

```bash
make dev
```

This command will start the Actix server at `http://localhost:3000` and automatically restart it when code changes are detected.

### Cleaning Up

To clean up build artifacts, run:

```bash
make clean
```
